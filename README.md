# Heart-Diseasa-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Machine-learning

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. It involves various techniques and methods to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within datasets. By exploring various techniques such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and data visualization, we can extract meaningful information and drive success. This presentation will provide an overview of data analysis for heart disease dataset and also prediction of status of heart disease of patient using logistic regression model in machine learning.

	The dataset selected for analysis is “Heart Disease Dataset”, which contains various instances or observations, where each instance represents individual patient or subject.
	We obtained this dataset from Kaggle, an open source website.
	The dataset consists of various attributes or variables that describes the patients demographics, medical history and diagnostic test results. 
	Dataset consists of 1025 rows and 14 columns.
	The “Target” field refers to the presence of heart disease in patient. It is integer valued  0= no disease and 1= disease.
